    <h1 class="lesson">Lesson 1.1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">How the Web Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. A person types in a domain name to access a web page using a computer browser such as Chrome, Opera, Safari, or, when desperate, Internet Explorer. When the person goes to the web page,
      the computer sends an <b>HTTP Request</b> to a <b>Server</b>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where said web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/kyvy45g">Components of the Web Video</a></b> does a good job of explaining the concept.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">HTML</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <b>text content</b> which describes "what you see" and <b>markup</b>      which describes "how it looks".
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ml235wp">
          Intro to HTML Video</a></b> gives a good overview.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Tags and Elements</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. An element begins with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
      <br>
      <br> This <b><a href="http://tinyurl.com/l5ozwqg">Into to HTML Tags Video</a></b> explains the distinction well.</p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Programmers Don't Have to Know Everything</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      There are so many details involved with coding. A rookie mistake is to try to memorize everything. It is more common to copy and paste bits of code, and Google will become your best friend.
      <br>
      <br>That is why I actually used Andy's Notes as the foundation of the assignment and tweaked it for my purposes. (I hope that this is allowed!) :-)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them while inline elements appear, well, inline. Go figure. For future reference, span is inline, and div is block.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">CSS</h2>
    <p class="info">
      <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document within the markup language. CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. For more detailed information about
      CSS, see <a href="  http://www.w3.org/wiki/Inheritance_and_cascade">this explanation.</a>

    <h1 class="lesson">Lesson 1.3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">The Relationship of CSS to the Web Page</h2>
    <p class="info">By giving similar HTML elements the same 'class', we can write all the styling for that class just ONCE and it will apply to every element.
      <br>
      <br>Style: The 'style' of an HTML element is just a bunch of rules which describe how that element should look. This style can be specified in a CSS file.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Benefits of Avoiding Repetition</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">If you give the same style to similar elements, you can change all of them at once just by changing a single line of CSS. If you give the same style to similar elements, you become a #winner when you are able to quickly and easily modify all of them
      at once just by changing a single line of CSS.
      <br>
      <br>Extra Bonus: This also limits the potential for errors. The final benefit is that it saves a TON of time.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">The Relationship Between Indented HTML and Boxes</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box"" is.
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Tips: Box Sizing and Equally Fun Four-Sided Stuff</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>You can set the size of a box in px or %. If you used pixels, it is static, so it is not responsive. This can result in a bad user experience.</li>
      <li>Using flexbox (flexible box) is an efficient way to layout space in a container. It gives you a way to have your HTML elements easily adjust their size based on the size of the page. A <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">complete guide</a>        to flexbox can be found here.</li>
      <li>Divs are block elements as opposed to inline elements, so, by default, they take up the entire width of their parent element. Adding the rule <em>"display: flex;"</em> to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to
        each other.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Important Definitions</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li><u>Computer</u>: A computer is a machine that can carry out instructions given to it by a programmer.</li>
      <li><u>Programming</u>: Tells the computer what to do through the use of a precise sequence of steps.</li>
      <li><u>Computer Programming Language</u>: A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python is one example of a programming language.</li>
      <li><u>Python</u>: Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press "Run", a Python Interpreter converts the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.</li>
      <li><u>Grammar</u>: Grammar refers to the rules that govern what statements are 'legal' in a language. Python has its own grammar.</li>
      <li><u>Python Expressions</u>: A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: <em>print 1 + 1</em> is a valid expression, but <em>print 1 +</em> (without a number at the end) is not.</li>

  <div>
    <p class="info">
      Why do we need to invent new languages like Python rather than using natural languages like English or Mandarin?
      <ol>
        <li>Ambiguity - We often have different meanings for the same word, and the computer needs specificity.</li>
        <li>Verbosity - Computers need a more efficient language.</li>
